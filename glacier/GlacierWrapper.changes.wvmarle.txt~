class log_class_call(object): renamed "enter" to "start" and "exit" to "finish" as that describes them better, and "exit" is a reserved word so should not be used as variable name.

General:
- made changes to general style like spaces both sides of an = sign unless keyword in function call.
- corrected grammar & spelling in comments.
- where you log success, you should also log failure.
- corrected strings: between triple-quotes, don't use indentation on second and subsequent lines as the leading spaces remain in the string.
- pytz is not part of the python standard library; no alternative in datetime or so?
